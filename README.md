# Sovereigna Labs

**Sovereigna** is a decentralized citizen governance protocol.
We are not creating a product, but a radically new model of government:
A government without politicians, without hierarchy, without taxes—governed solely by its citizens.

## 📜 Manifesto

The full manifesto is available in [Manifeste_Sovereigna.pdf](./Manifeste_Sovereigna.pdf).
It describes our vision: a democracy encoded in the blockchain, governed by a citizenship NFT, and a constitutional DAO.

## 📌 Objectives

- Build a sovereign digital citizenship (NFT)
- Implement a transparent and decentralized DAO
- Experiment with a new social contract
- Prepare the physical embodiment of the model
- Obtain legal recognition as a post-state nation

## 🧪 Sovereigna Labs

Sovereigna Labs is the technopolitical laboratory for this project.
We are developing:
- Smart contracts (citizen NFTs, DAOs)
- Voting and governance infrastructure
- Collective treasury
- Open source citizen coordination tools

## 🤝 Join

No permission required. No KYC.
One NFT = one citizenship.

Join the Discord, start contributing, propose amendments to our Constitution, and develop the tools.
